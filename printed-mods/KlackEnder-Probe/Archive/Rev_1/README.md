## KlackEnder Probe *Revision 1*

KlackEnder Probe - **Simple, fast and cheap!**
  
Adaptation of the [Klicky](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe)/[Quickdraw](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe) Probe for the Ender 3 and comparable         Creality printers. The probe is compatible with all printers that use the X plate of the Ender 3. The cost of the probe is <5â‚¬, of which the switch is the most expensive part.
The probe is compatible with **Marlin and Klipper**. Both firmwares work with the G29 command, the docking is done automatically by the printer, it couldn't be easier! Both    firmwares add a KlackEnder menu to the display that can be used to dock and undock the Probe. The Bed-Mesh can be created via the custom menu, via the default formware settings or with G29. **Important note: You have to set the offset to the z limit switch, not to the probe! The printer calculates the first layer from the z endstops position and the probed mesh!**

### Quick Overview:
- Compatible with Marlin and Klipper. Firmware is provided.
- Automatic docking and undocking of the probe.
- Custom menu to control the probe.
- Cheap way to get fast and accurate probing.
- Easy to install, no soldering.
- Works with all print surfaces

### BOM - Parts you need:
- 1x OMRON D2F or similar switch
- 4x Magnet 6x3mm 
- 2x M3x8mm screw (SHCS or BHCS doesn't matter)
- 3x M5x8mm screw (SHCS or BHCS doesn't matter)
- 3x M5 t-nut
- small zip tie and some cable (you may also need a connector to connect the probe to the mainboard e.g JST XH)


## Assembly Guide
I made a short video about the assembly and installation of the probe.

Wiring and firmware changes are described at the bottom of the page.

## Wiring Guide
Since there is no polarity on Swichtes, it doesn't matter which wire goes where. Just connect the switch to the two marked pins.
In the next chapter about firmware changes you will see where to add the pin.

**If you want me to add more mainboards feel free to contact me on Discord: kevinakasam#2097**

## Firmware Guide
The KlackEnder probe works with Marlin and Klipper. This guide only shows you what changes you need to make to the firmware, not how to modify/upload the firmware itself. There are several guides online for different boards and printers.
**You do not have to use the ```Probe In``` or ```Probe Out``` macros.** They're just a nice to have. The printer will do this automatically when you send a ```G29```.

**Important note: You have to set the offset to the z limit switch, not to the probe! The printer calculates the first layer from the z endstops position and the probed mesh!**

### Klipper

The installation for Klipper is pretty easy. Simply copy the code from the ```KlackEnder.cfg```to your ```printer.cfg```
The ```[gcode_macro G29]``` does the same like the ```[gcode_macro AUTO_BED_MESH]```. I just added this so you can use the G29 commend as usual.

**Don't forgot to edit your probe Pin:**

  #bicubic_tension: .2
  #   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
  #   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
  #   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
  #   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.

### Marlin
### Marlin
The installation for Marlin requires some more changes, but I will guide you through this :). These changes are only to get the KlackEnder working correctly. You still need to configure the rest of the options as appropriate for your printer. Support for the KlackEnder and similar probes was only recently added so a current version of Marlin needs to be used. Go to ```https://marlinfw.org/meta/download/``` and download the ```2.1.x.zip```. Follow the instructions for downloading, Installing, and configuring VSCode. Before compiling with PlatformIO you will need to setup your config files. Go to ```https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/bugfix-2.1.x/config/examples/Creality``` find your Printer/board setup and down load the appropriate Configuration.h & Configuration_adv.h. At this point you will want to go through and make the changes below, once completed you should be good to compile and use your printer. We are working on getting Configuration files posted for common printer combinations as well as .bins uploaded.

Marlin will now include a probe deploy and stow option under the motion menu when the Mag_mounted probe is defined.

#### 1. Configuration.h
- Search for ``` #define Z_MIN_PROBE_USES_Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_PIN``` (line 1244) comment out by adding ```//``` before ```#define```

- Search for ``` //#define MAG_MOUNTED_PROBE``` (line 1349) uncomment by removing the ```//```
  and change lines 1354-1363 to 
  ```
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_DEPLOY_1 { PROBE_DEPLOY_FEEDRATE, { 245, 114, 30 } }  // Move to side Dock
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_DEPLOY_2 { PROBE_DEPLOY_FEEDRATE, { 245, 114, 0 } }  // Move down to probe / Attach probe
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_DEPLOY_3 { PROBE_DEPLOY_FEEDRATE, { 245, 114, 20 } }  // lift probe up
  //#define MAG_MOUNTED_DEPLOY_4 { PROBE_DEPLOY_FEEDRATE, {   0,   0,  0 } }  // Extra move if needed
  //#define MAG_MOUNTED_DEPLOY_5 { PROBE_DEPLOY_FEEDRATE, {   0,   0,  0 } }  // Extra move if needed
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_STOW_1   { PROBE_STOW_FEEDRATE,   { 245, 114, 20 } }  // Move to dock
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_STOW_2   { PROBE_STOW_FEEDRATE,   { 245, 114,  0 } }  // Place probe on dock
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_STOW_3   { PROBE_STOW_FEEDRATE,   { 240, 114,  0 } }  // Side move to remove probe
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_STOW_4   { PROBE_STOW_FEEDRATE,   { 240, 114, 20 } }  // Side move to remove probe
  //#define MAG_MOUNTED_STOW_5   { PROBE_STOW_FEEDRATE,   {   0,   0,  0 } }  // Extra move if needed
  ```
  Probe deploy and stow feedrate can be changed by edditing line's 1351-1352


- Search for ```NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET``` (line 1453) and change
  ```
  #define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { 10, 10, 0 }

  // Most probes should stay away from the edges of the bed, but
  // with NOZZLE_AS_PROBE this can be negative for a wider probing area.
  #define PROBING_MARGIN 10
  ```

  to 

  ```
  #define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { 8, 21, 1.2 }   --> set correct offset

  // Most probes should stay away from the edges of the bed, but
  // with NOZZLE_AS_PROBE this can be negative for a wider probing area.
  #define PROBING_MARGIN 15   --> more clearance to the sides of the bed.
  ```
