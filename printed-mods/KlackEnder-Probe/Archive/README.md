## KlackEnder Probe

KlackEnder Probe - **Simple, fast and cheap!**
  
Adaptation of the [Klicky](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe)/[Quickdraw](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe) Probe for the Ender 3 and comparable         Creality printers. The probe is compatible with all printers that use the X plate of the Ender 3. The cost of the probe is <5â‚¬, of which the switch is the most expensive part.
The probe is compatible with **Marlin and Klipper**. Both firmwares work with the G29 command, the docking is done automatically by the printer, it couldn't be easier! Both    firmwares add a KlackEnder menu to the display that can be used to dock and undock the Probe. The Bed-Mesh can be created via the custom menu, via the default formware settings or with G29.

I recommend to use the Rev2!

### Quick Overview:
- Compatible with Marlin and Klipper. Firmware is provided.
- Automatic docking and undocking of the probe.
- Custom menu to control the probe.
- Cheap way to get fast and accurate probing.
- Easy to install, no soldering.
- Works with all print surfaces
- **Use it as Z Endstop with the Rev2**

### Rev_1 vs. Rev_2
What's the difference between Revision 1 and Revion 2?
                   
The most important difference is the position of the probe. With the Rev2, the probe is attached to the X-axis, which is why the probe can be used as a Z end stop. So no additional port for an end stop is needed and the probe can simply be connected to the old Z endstop port. The renders below show the difference, the upper one is the Rev2. (The Probe mount on the hotendplate is the same for both version)
