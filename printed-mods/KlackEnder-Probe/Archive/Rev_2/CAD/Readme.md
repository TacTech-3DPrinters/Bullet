# How to change the tolerances

There is an f3d file in the CAD folder. This file format is for Autodesk Fusion 360, a free CAD program for private users. You can use it to adjust the tolerances if the STL files I provided do not fit.
As described in the tolerance test, there are different tolerances for vertical and horizontal holes. Follow the steps below to create your own STL.

## 1: Open the fusion file
First you have upload the file to fusion. Simply double click on the file or upload it to the browser in fusion on the left side (once you opended a folder e.g `My First Project` theres a small blue upload option at the very top). Then open the file, it should look close to this:

## 2: Open the parameters tab

Click on the `MODIFY`dropdown and select the parameters option.

## 4: Find the file you want to export

Find the file you want to export in the browser on the left side. You can expand the folders by clicking on the small triangles. (You can also double click on the file in the CAD window, right click on it and select `Find In Browser`at the very end of the menu).

## 5: Export the STL

Once you found the file you want to export, right click on it and select `Save As Mesh`.

## 6: Save the STL

Simply confirm the small dialog on the right by clicking `OK`. Select a place on you PC to save it, that's all :)
