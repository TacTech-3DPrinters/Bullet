All parts can be printed without supports. Just print them in the provided orientation.

**Print the tolerance test first!**
All horizontal holes have a tolerance of 0.2mm, all vertical ones have no tolerance. This should fit most printers and give you a tight fit. If the fit isn't right use the provided CAD files to change the tolerance. The f3d file has paramters for that (Check out my [website](https://kevinakasam.com/lets-adapt-the-cad/)). You could also join the discord and I will send you a file with the tolerances you want.
